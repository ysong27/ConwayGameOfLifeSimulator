# Conway's Game of Life Simulator
Cellular automation simulation of John Conway's "Game of Life" using JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap

# Rules
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
